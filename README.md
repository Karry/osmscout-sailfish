Goal of this project is to bring offline maps and navigation to Sailfish OS 
with native look and feel. OSM Scout for Sailfish OS is based 
on [OSM Scout](http://libosmscout.sourceforge.net/) library.

You can choose one from multiple map styles: *standard*, *outdoor*, *public transport* or *winter sports*. 
All with the same database that can be downloaded (per state) directly from the application for offline usage.
Data on the server covers whole planet and are updated monthly from OpenStreetMap data. 
You can [generate your own extract](http://libosmscout.sourceforge.net/tutorials/importing/) eventually, 
all tools are open-source and OpenStreetMap data are free!  

For better outdoor experience, databases (almost all) contains elevation contours and hillshade overlay (online) can be displayed.     
For areas not covered by offline data are used online maps provided by OpenStreetMap or Stamen Design.
But search and navigation works only with offline data.     

Your favourite places (waypoints) can be stored to collections and exported to GPX files later. 
It is even possible to import tracks and waypoints from GPX files, display it on map or show simple statistics. 

You can help to improve this application by reporting bugs, creating translations or developing new features. 
Any help is welcome!
